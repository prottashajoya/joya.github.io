# GitHub Pages Minimal Mistakes Starter

1. Create a public repo named `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.
2. Upload these files (or clone and push).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose “Deploy from a branch” with `main` at `/ (root)`.
4. Edit `_config.yml` (title, author links) and `_data/navigation.yml` to suit you.
5. Add your CV as `cv.pdf` at repo root (optional).

**No local Ruby setup needed**: this uses `remote_theme` and GitHub Pages' default build.
