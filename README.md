# One‑Page Academic Homepage (feye2024-style)

**How to use**
1. Create a public repo named `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.
2. Upload these files.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**, choose “Deploy from a branch” (main / root).
4. Edit `index.html` (name, links, content). Put images into `assets/img/`.
5. Optional: add `cv.pdf` at root and link it in the footer.

No frameworks required — plain HTML/CSS with smooth scroll and anchor nav.
